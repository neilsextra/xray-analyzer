# Example Python/Flask Application

Little application using filtering techniques on XRAY images.

Does require a keys.py file or environmental variables to be set prior to initiating the web server.

An example **keys.py** file

```
{
  "account_key": "",
  "account_name": "",
  "container_name": "images"
}
```
